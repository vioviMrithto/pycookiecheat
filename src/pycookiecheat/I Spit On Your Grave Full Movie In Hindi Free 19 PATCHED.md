The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances of Nani and Samantha, the story, screenplay and dialogues by Gautham Menon and Reshma Ghatala, and the soundtracks and background score by Ilaiyaraaja, but criticized the slow pace and length of the film. The Times of India gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and stated that "the movie unravels at a pace of its own and has very few whistle-moments and has loads of drama. This movie is definitely a new feather in Samantha's cap." Radhika Rajamani of Rediff gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and said that the film is a "believable love story. Yeto Vellipoyindi Manasu is packaged with average ingredients -- a fairly average and sensitive screenplay, fine performances by the lead pair, Nani and Samantha, melodious music by the maestro Ilaiyaraaja and decent production." APHerald.com gave the film 2.75 out of 5 stars and wrote that it is "can watch one time". Only for people associated with love 'ever in their life', May do well at multiplexes but not a commercial hit." The Hindu declared that the film was like a "breeze" and felt that the film should be watched one time "with the person you love. An extra dose of patience will help". IndiaGlitz gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and said "to be fair to Gautham Menon, he has delivered a realistic conversational love story. If it was AR Rehman's music that was Ye Maya Chesave's raison d' etre, it is the class act of both Samantha and Nani (who is nothing less than a revelation) that keeps some of us glued." Oneindia Entertainment gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote: "overall, Yeto Vellipoyindi Manasu has superb performance by Nani and Samantha. But its dragging narration kills the viewers' interest." Idlebrain.com gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and felt that the film is a "daring attempt by Gowtam Menon to narrate a moments-based film without bothering about payoffs. On a whole, YVM is a multiplex film and we got to wait and see how it fares." CNN-IBN gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and also felt that Gautham Menon has delivered a "realistic conversational love story" and lauded the lead pair for their "classy act.[34]
